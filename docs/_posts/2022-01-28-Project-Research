[Designing for Disability: Evaluating the State of Accessibility Design in Video Games ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1555412020971500?casa_token=ANea-RrryfUAAAAA%3AanyC7cr_1RR2llgV9vGIPtvV2OwApG6VE9vKzVN6DqWoZBaG4V6TEsSTAEJBrIETKhRH6suq67-c)
attempts to provide readers with insight into the common practices and shortcomings with respect to accessibility in the video game industry. The paper analyzes several areas of accessibility including auditory, visual and motor accessibility, and provides industry examples of effective and not-so-effective strategies employed to allow for more accessibility in these areas. Following its analysis of these methods, the paper provides general recommendations to developers regarding good practices to follow when designing for accessibility. The piece found that many games that deploy accessibility strategies - while often good-intentioned - often fail to “dive deeper” and simply throw things like subtitles into their games, without considering other crucial aspects like font size, positioning and UI sizing. The paper asserts that developers should take a more holistic approach to designing for accessibility, and should consider the entire user experience when doing so.

[Creating a Rhythm Audio Game](https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/503906/Janne%20Soikkeli%20Bachelor%27s%20Thesis.pdf?sequence=2), by Janne Soikkeli, outlines the development process behind Soikkeli’s rhythm based 2D-scroller, Heartbeat: Regret, intended to be accessible to both visually impaired and visually inimpaired users alike. The game uses typing as its primary form of user interaction, and users type commands on beat based on audio signals given. Unsurprisingly, the bulk of the paper was about the sound engine used in the game, as sound became the primary way of communicating game-critical information to the player. Soikkeli used a variety of tools and techniques, such as audio occlusion and very carefully placed audio listeners, to create a sound-based environment that would allow users to identify the location of different key objects in the game. In addition to gameplay, the project also used sound to attempt to create a story and immersive feel for the player, and utilized sound to provide the player with a number of environmental storytelling elements. The author found that the primary difficulties of the project were ensuring that the visual and audio components of the game worked together cohesively, and that no information placed in the visual component of the game was left out of the audio component, and vice versa. The developer found that a standard rule that became extremely useful in the development process was “if a visual element was to be added to the game world… it should have an audial component as well”.

[Racing in the Dark: Exploring Accessible Virtual Reality by Developing a Racing Game for People who are Blind](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1071181321651224?casa_token=KgN8xjF8rxYAAAAA:25bFzRqMYhezg9trQYrfuITRDhxbMyZHrogPfQLrEAoWTD_W_tIs17Ed6VJFy5rRSjBPB08d5mcc) provides an overview of the design and development process used when creating Racing in the Dark - a VR racing game for the Oculus Rift that allows users who are mostly or even entirely blind to race against AI. The team behind the project states that they sought to “[push] the current VR game design boundaries by bringing the usually supplemental feedback system (e.g. haptics and audio) to the forefront, providing multisensory time-sensitive information”. The primary goal of the project was to bring the field of fast-paced games, where information and decision points are presented to the user extremely quickly, to a more accessible standing. As such, the team found that fast-paced critical information delivery was the main problem to tackle for the project. The paper details the resulting system that the team developed to provide the user experience, and describes how different auditory cues (both prompted by the user and not prompted by the user), as well as controls based on gestures (such as turning your head to look out the car window), can help to provide the user with an immersive experience, without relying too heavily on a single replacement for visual cues.

Márcia de Borba Camos and Juliana Damasio Oliveira’s [Usability, Accessibility and Gameplay Heuristics to Evaluate Audiogames for Users Who are Blind](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-40250-5_4), seeks to provide a framework by which developers can evaluate audio based games in order to identify the games requirements and issues in the game. The paper provides 10 heuristics by which developers can design and evaluate their audio games in order to create a more seamless experience for visually impaired users. Each heuristic presented in the paper attempts to make a claim that a good audiogame should follow this heuristic, and then supports this claim by connecting the heuristic provided to an element of a standard video game. The piece claims, for example, that a good audio game should rely more on recognition than on recall, and claims that video based games rely on this same principle with the use of easily recognizable icons and images for menus and other game elements. The primary takeaway from this paper is that most elements from a traditional video game can and should be emulated in an audio based game in order to provide users with an immersive and non-frustrating experience.

[The Role Sound Plays in Games: A Thematic Literature Study on Immersion, Inclusivity and Accessibility in Game Sound Research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3464327.3464365?casa_token=WHel7Sbzt6UAAAAA:FTzU8cle5kqWp6cmskWrYaOJJ4qlFYbSn0oxQ45Nl9aCLBCmDx_dL4jWqcX9tWvj7NO3RjvlqjYq) looks at the myriad of ways sound is employed in video games and to what effect. The piece also looks at sound in video games as a tool for inclusivity and accessibility and argues that as the complexity of audio in games increases, so too can its use in creating these inclusive and accessible pieces of software. One of the more interesting points of the paper from a game design perspective is that sound design and implementation in games should be purposeful, as carefully chosen sounds can convey important information to users, can “engender feelings of happiness”, or even help players focus in the game. The primary takeaway from the paper is that sound design in games should be well thought out - as much, if not more so than any other game mechanics. Players can connect with the game through sound - they can learn about the world, experience emotions and gain critical game-related information from sound, and developers should take care to make sure sound design in their games is carefully crafted.
