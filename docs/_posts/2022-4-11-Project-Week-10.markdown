 <p>
The primary goal for this week was to finally implement a system that allows the user to navigate in-game menus without the use of visuals. The system put in place uses a "click to scroll, double click to activate" functioanlity to allow users to navigate menus. 
This interface provides very quick menu navigation, comparable to that of the base-game, and I believe that users will find the system very intuitive and quick to pick up and remember. Adding this system allowed me to finally implement some of the missing functionality in the game, 
  such as navigating the backpack and using "special" items, such as the arcane stylus to inscribe armor. In addition to these tasks, this weeks work involved some quality of life improvements, such as streamlining the item use process, adding support for some ranged weapons, and 
  making tidying up some of the existing code.
